RESIZE GRID

Resize Grid is an Aseprite Extension that allows to easily adjust the grid size by increasing or decreasing it to suit their needs.

This uses keyboard shortcuts or navigating the extension's options in the menu. Additionally, users can customize the scaling of the grid size, ensuring that the changes are to their preferences.

These settings are automatically saved and will persist the next time Aseprite is opened, allowing for a seamless and efficient workflow.

How To Install

1. Download the file here.
2. Execute the .aseprite-extension and install that.
3. Restart the Aseprite to use this plugin.

Requirements

A sprite must be open to use this extension. If no sprite is open, the plugin will display an alert message and prevent the extension from launching.

How to use

Resize Grid can be accessed through the View menu. You can perform the grid resizing either by selecting the options provided or by modifying the default settings. Additionally, shortcuts are available for quick execution of the resizing process.

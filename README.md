Resize Grid is an Aseprite Extension that allows to easily adjust the grid size by increasing or decreasing it to suit their needs.
<p></p>
This uses keyboard shortcuts or navigating the extension's options in the menu. Additionally, users can customize the scaling of the grid size, ensuring that the changes are to their preferences.
These settings are automatically saved and will persist the next time Aseprite is opened, allowing for a seamless and efficient workflow.

<h2>How To Install</h2>

1. Download the file here.
2. Execute the .aseprite-extension and install that.
3. Restart the Aseprite to use this plugin.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

A sprite must be open to use this extension. If no sprite is open, the plugin will display an alert message and prevent the extension from launching.

<h2>How to use</h2>

Resize Grid can be accessed through the View menu. You can perform the grid resizing either by selecting the options provided or by modifying the default settings. Additionally, shortcuts are available for quick execution of the resizing process.

In the Settings window, you can adjust a key parameter that determines the scaling factor for your grid.

<p></p>
The Scale parameter controls how much the grid size will increase or decrease, with selectable values ranging from 1 to 10. If needed, you can easily reset the scale to the default value of 2.
This plugin also provides two buttons (similar to the menu actions) that allow you to test your adjustments in real-time.
